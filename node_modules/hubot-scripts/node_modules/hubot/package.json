  "readme": "# Hubot\n\nThis is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.\n\n**You'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly.**\n\nInstead this repo provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you\nsimply require in your project. Follow the instructions below and get your own\nhubot ready to deploy.\n\n## Getting your own\n\nMake sure you have [node.js][nodejs] and [npm][npmjs] (npm comes with node v0.6.3+) installed.\n\nDownload the [latest version of hubot][hubot-latest].\n\nThen follow the instructions in the [README][readme] in the extracted `hubot`\ndirectory.\n\n[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org\n[npmjs]: http://npmjs.org\n[hubot-latest]: https://github.com/github/hubot/downloads\n[readme]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/templates/README.md\n\n## Adapters\n\nAdapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on. This\ncan be something like Campfire or IRC. There are a number of third party\nadapters that the community have contributed. Check the\n[hubot wiki][hubot-wiki] for the available ones and how to create your own.\n\nPlease submit issues and pull requests for third party adapters to the adapter\nrepo not this repo unless it's the Campfire or Shell adapter.\n\n[hubot-wiki]: https://github.com/github/hubot/wiki\n[third-party-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/src/adapters/third-party\n[split-subpath]: http://help.github.com/split-a-subpath-into-a-new-repo/\n[logjs]: https://github.com/visionmedia/log.js\n\n## hubot-scripts\n\nHubot ships with a number of default scripts, but there's a growing number of\nextras in the [hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] repository. `hubot-scripts` is a\nway to share scripts with the entire community.\n\nCheck out the [README][hubot-scripts-readme] for more help on installing\nindividual scripts.\n\n[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts\n[hubot-scripts-readme]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts#readme\n\n## HTTP Listener\n\nHubot has a HTTP listener which listens on the port specified by the `PORT`\nenvironment variable.\n\nYou can specify routes to listen on in your scripts by using the `router`\nproperty on `robot`.\n\n```coffeescript\nmodule.exports = (robot) ->\n  robot.router.get \"/hubot/version\", (req, res) ->\n    res.end robot.version\n```\n\nThere are functions for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, which all take a route and\ncallback function that accepts a request and a response.\n\n## Testing hubot locally\n\nInstall all of the required dependencies by running `npm install`.\n\nIt's easy to test scripts locally with an interactive shell:\n\n    % export PATH=\"node_modules/.bin:$PATH\"\n    % bin/hubot\n\n... and to run unit tests:\n\n    % make test\n\n",
