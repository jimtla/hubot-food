# Hubot-Food

A hubot plugin that let's you make group orders from the comfort of your own chat room.

Built for ordrin's food hack day in NYC.

All the actual code lives in: node_modules/hubot-scripts/src/scripts/food.coffee, the rest is just a fork of Hubot. We are aware that checking in node_modules is a bad idea, but it was a 6 hour hackathon... give us a break :)
